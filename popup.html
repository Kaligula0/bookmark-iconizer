		<div><p>You want to set icons for your bookmarks? Go <a href="options.html" target="_blank">HERE</a> <small>(this is options page of this extension, so you can also right-click the icon.) Note that after you set the favicons the extension may be turned off until next use or removed completely – the icons will stay changed forever. (But that doesn't change the fact that while turned on it doesn't use any of your computer resources, so you can also leave it on 😉)</small></p></div>
